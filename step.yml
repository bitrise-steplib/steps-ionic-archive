title: Ionic archive
summary: Generates builds for the requested platforms.
description: |-
  Generates an iOS, Android or an iOS and Android build based on your Step settings and a `build.json` file which is inherited from the **Generate cordova build configuration** Step.
 
  ### Configuring the Step
  1. In the **Platform to use in ionic-cli commands** input, select the platform you wish to build for from the drop-down menu.
  2. In the **Build command configuration** input, select either `debug` or `release` mode from the drop-down menu. If you set `release` to generate a release build, then you should select `device` instead of `emulator` in the **Build command target**.
  3. Select either `emulator` or `device` in the **Build command target** field.
  4. Make sure the file path set in the **Working directory** is pointing to the path where your project's code got downloaded to.
  If you're using any services of the Ionic framework which requires login credentials, you have to provide those in the **Ionic username** and **Ionic password** inputs. Don't worry, these are stored as secret Environment Variables.
  If you wish to to modify your native projects by inserting the **Ionic Prepare** Step before the **Ionic Archive** Step, then make sure you set the **Should `ionic cordova prepare` be executed before `ionic cordova build`?** input to `false` in the **Ionic Archive** Step.
  The **Build configuration path to describe code signing properties** input is automatically filled out with the output Environment Variable of the **Generate cordova build configuation** Step. You do not need to modify this input.

  ### Troubleshooting
  Make sure you add the **Ionic Archive** Step AFTER the **Generate cordova build configuration** Step as the latter generates the build config file which the **Ionic Archive** Step uses to successfully build an iOS and/or Android project.
  Make sure you insert the **Ionic Archive** Step BEFORE any deploy Step.
  Note that if you’re building for both iOS and Android in one workflow, and either of your apps fails, the whole **Ionic Archive** Step will fail.
  If you set the **Build configuration** input in the **Generate Cordova Build Configuration** Step to `release`, then you need to use the release configuration in the **Ionic Archive** Step as well.

      description: |-
        Use this input to specify custom options, to append to the end of the ionic-cli build command.

        Cordova does not yet support the new build system made default in XCode 10 (https://github.com/apache/cordova-ios/issues/407).
        To use the legacy build system add `-- --buildFlag="-UseModernBuildSystem=0"` to the options string.

        Example:
        - `--browserify`
